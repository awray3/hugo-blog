I'm Andrew Wray, and I am a data scientist and mathematician based in Seattle, WA. I completed my PhD
in Algebraic Geometry at the University of Oregon in June 2020 under the guidance of [Nick Addington](https://pages.uoregon.edu/adding/), and now I work
as a data scientist for [Fullpower Technologies](https://www.fullpower.com/)
developing and enhancing AI-based algorithms for
[Sleeptracker](https://www.sleeptracker.com/).

In my spare time I enjoy reading science fiction, playing the drums and guitar,
and hanging out with my [cat](/img/chiyoh.png).

If you wish to get in contact with me, send me an email at `andrew.wray2718[at]gmail[dot]com` or reach out on LinkedIn.
