I completed my PhD in Algebraic Geometry at the University of Oregon in June 2020 under the guidance of Nick Addington, and now I work as a data scientist for Fullpower Technologies developing and enhancing AI-based algorithms for Sleeptracker.
In my spare time I enjoy reading science fiction, playing the drums and guitar, and hanging out with my cat.</description></item><item><title>Research</title><link>awray3.github.io/research/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>awray3.github.io/research/</guid><description>In Mathematics Moduli Spaces of Twisted Hermite-Einstein Connections on K3 Surfaces.
